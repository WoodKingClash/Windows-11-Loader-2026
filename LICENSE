A Windows 11 Loader is a tool that is used by some users to activate Windows 11 without purchasing an official product key from Microsoft. The loader works by altering the system files or injecting specific code to bypass the regular activation process. However, while it may provide an immediate solution to the activation requirement, it's important to understand the implications of using such tools.
